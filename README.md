# DashBox App

---

**The toolbox dashboard! All of your productivity tools in one place!**

*The idea thus far*: Have one or more screens that allow you to drag-and-drop and combine different smaller tools (such as to-do lists, calculators, budgets, etc) together to create complex blocks of functionality that can be used to increase productivity in various areas.
